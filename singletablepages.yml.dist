# Configuration file for SingleTablePages.
#
# This should be copied somewhere OUTSIDE of the publicly available files. Ie,
# if the docroot is /var/www/htdocs, this file should be somewhere above that,
# such as /var/www, or adjacent, such as /var/www/libraries/singletablepages.
#
# You can have any number of these files, named differently, to set up multiple
# instances of SingleTablePages. Each time you invoke SingleTablePages, either
# on a web page or on the command line (for refreshing the data) you reference
# this configuration file.
#
# Because this is a YAML file, remember that whitespace is important.

# Database credentials: this is required.
database name: myDatabase
database user: myUser
database password: myPassword
database host: localhost
database table: myTable

# Base URL for the dynamic page. Also required.
base url: my/dynamic/page

# Everything else in this document is optional.

# If you want to control what the URL parameter is, set that here. Otherwise the
# default is "stp". For example: http://example.com/my/dynamic/page?stf=123
url parameter: stp

# List the columns that should be output as links, using another columns to
# get the destination URLs. For example, if you wanted to display the row's
# title as a link to a document, you might do something like this:
# (The format should be: Link label : Link URL)
output as links:
    myTitleField: myDocumentURLField

# List the columns that should be output as images. This assumes that the data
# in these columns is the "src" attribute of an image.
#output as images:
#    - myImageSrcField

# List the columns that should function as additional values for another column.
# For example, if you have a Tag and Tag2 column, you could indicate that Tag2
# is just additional values for Tag, and they would both appear together.
columns for additional values:
    # Extra column: Main column
    myDatabaseColumn1: myDatabaseColumn2

# Excel stores dates in a weird way, and it's a waste of processing power to
# convert it dynamically, so we assume that all date columns will be DATETIME
# columns. Consequently, you should list here any columns that are formatted
# as dates in the source Excel spreadsheet, so they can be converted once as
# they are being imported. Otherwise, MySQL will not let you import them.
#convert from excel dates:
#    - myDatabaseColumn1

# Similarly, if the source data is storing dates as Unix timestamps, make sure
# to note that here so that they will be converted into MySQL DATETIME values.
#convert from unix dates:
#    - myDatabaseColumn2

# If any of the database table's columns are DATETIME columns, then you can
# list them here along with a PHP date format string to use when displaying the
# dates on the page.
#date formats:
#    myDatabaseColumn1: 'M Y'
#    myDatabaseColumn2: 'M j, Y'

# If there are any special characters or phrases that need to be altered when
# importing the data from the CSV file, indicate those here. For example, to
# change all occurences of ยง with &#167; uncomment the lines below.
#text alterations:
#    "ยง": "&#167;"
